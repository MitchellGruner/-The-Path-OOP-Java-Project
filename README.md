# -The-Path-OOP-Java-Project
An Object-Oriented Programming in Java application that allows users to control an “ant” that must evade “spiders” In the game world.  
The user must collide with “flags” and “food stations” in order to succeed, and the movements of all of the game objects are clearly visible 
in a container within an iPad III emulator.  This application uses a library that closely resembles Java Swing.

This project was divided up by three assignments for my CSc 133 class from California State University, Sacramento.  Although this code is
completely mine, how I derived the code is completely from the university.
